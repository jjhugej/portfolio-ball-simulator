# portfolio-ball-simulator
A simulator that accounts for mass and velocity of randomly generated balls as they slam into one another and bounce around the canvas. Built with JavaScript.

In order to see the project download the folder and open the Dist folder. Within Dist open index.html with your browser of choice.

Objectives:
⦁	Animate randomly generated balls on an HTML canvas
⦁	Detect collisions between each of the balls
⦁	Account for mass and velocity of each ball and use the elastic collision formula to move the balls accordingly

This project was a spin off of the very first game I created in javascript: pong. The goal was to simulate 2D physics by having balls(circles) of different sizes bounce into one another. The effect is that a larger ball would have a very small net change in velocity and direction if a smaller ball moving at high speeds collided with it, and vice versa.
